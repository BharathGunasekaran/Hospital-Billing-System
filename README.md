A Hospital Billing System using Linked List in C is a program designed to manage patient billing efficiently, particularly in a hospital setting. The system typically stores patient records and billing information in a linked list structure, where each node contains the details for one patient. This approach is useful because linked lists allow for dynamic memory allocation and ease of insertion, deletion, and traversal of records.

Key Components:

Patient Record Structure:

  A struct containing patient details (name, age, illness, etc.), billing information (consultation fees, medication costs, total bill, etc.), and a pointer to the next node.

Linked List:

  Each node in the list represents a patient's record. The system can add, delete, or modify records easily using the linked list structure.

Functions:
  
  Add New Patient: Adds a new patient’s billing details to the system.
  
  Display Bill: Shows billing information for a specific patient.
  
  Delete Record: Deletes a patient’s record from the system once their bill is cleared.
  
  Update Bill: Updates a patient’s billing details, such as adding costs for additional services.
  
  Search Patient: Finds a patient’s record based on their unique identifier.

Usages:

  Efficient Record Management: Since a linked list is dynamic, the system can grow as needed without wasting memory. New patients can be added, and old records can be removed without disrupting the entire system.
  
  Easy Traversal and Modification: The program can traverse the linked list to find and update patient records efficiently.
  
  Dynamic Data Handling: Useful in real-world hospital scenarios where the number of patients fluctuates and billing details need to be constantly updated.

Advantages:

  Memory Efficiency: Linked lists use memory only for the records that exist.
  
  Scalability: New records can be added seamlessly.
  
  Flexibility: Insertion, deletion, and modifications are straightforward.

This approach provides a simplified yet functional way to handle hospital billing through linked lists, ensuring flexibility and dynamic memory usage.
